# Principles of programming in Java

We introduce the core concepts of the Java programming language: values, variables, object references, arrays, classes, the call stack, and the heap, by means of a series of simple example programs. We do so using the [JLearner](https://btj.github.io/jlearner/) environment for visualizing the execution of Java code snippets.
